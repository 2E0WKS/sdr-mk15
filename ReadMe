See pdf for firmware update and xp / win 7
Note external power 5v OR usb with 650-700ma or twin lead as manual

****************Win 10 update the firmware as pdf and to HDSDR****************************

The compiled ExtIO causes windows to load the wrong driver and HDSDR crashes before it can explain the issue.

Create a restore point.

Now be careful as we want to update driver on both instances of the Andrus SDR. Have a look and you will get multiple instances that share common interface-DO NOT USE THESE AS YOU WILL BREAK THINGS.

It will become apparent we have 2 Andrus interfaces that are on their own- these are the ones we want to use Zadig to update to lib-usb on both.
